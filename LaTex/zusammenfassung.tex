%%% Zusammenfassung:
Feedbacker is an app which gives users the ability to send location-based feedback. The app is available for Android and iOS. It is using Firebase as its backend.\\
This thesis presents the app and gives possible use cases. It also explains how Firebase works and in which ways it was used for Feedbacker. A special focus lies on the database function of Firebase as well as the security of the saved data as it handles sensible information in the form of the user's location.\\
Furthermore, this work also shows the process of developing an App for iOS and Android at the same time. Here, extra focus was given to the process of getting the current user's location. Also, a perspective on how to develop the App further is given.\\
As the app is not yet published, its success of it needs to be determined at a later time.
