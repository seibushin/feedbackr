MapView
- Radius max 3km
- move center on ActionButton click
- LRU structure to store Feedbacks

Feedbacks
- Add UserRef to the Feedback (not FeedbackRef to the user) - 1:N
- Get newest Feedback (orderByChild("date").last())

About
- change Layout (dont use WebView) ! performance

Profil
- Create user on first launch? or on first feedback submit
- the userId is stored on the device from firebase!?
- - userId does not need to be pushed to the firebase we can still query for Feedbacks using the local firebaes userId
